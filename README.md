# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list


# gopherquest
A gamified Golang Learning Platform


Expanded Storyline: "GopherQuest: Code of the Future"
Prologue: The Digital World
In a distant future, humanity has evolved into a highly advanced digital civilization where the real and virtual worlds are seamlessly intertwined. This vast digital realm is sustained by a powerful and ancient codebase, a creation so intricate and perfect that it has kept the digital universe running smoothly for centuries. The Golang Gophers, wise and agile creatures, are the esteemed guardians of this sacred code. Their role is not only to maintain its integrity but also to enhance its capabilities, ensuring the continued prosperity of their world.

The Threat: The Virus Emerges
However, peace in the digital realm is shattered when a mysterious and malevolent virus begins to spread. This virus, unlike any seen before, corrupts the code at an alarming rate, creating chaos and instability. Glitches manifest as anomalies, disrupting everyday life, and threatening the very fabric of the digital universe. Cities flicker in and out of existence, data streams become turbulent rivers of chaos, and entire sectors fall into darkness.

The Gopher Guild: Defenders of the Code
The Gopher Guild, an elite group of Gophers renowned for their mastery of Golang, steps up to confront this dire threat. These guardians are experts in debugging and restoring corrupted code, but the virus is a formidable foe, constantly adapting and growing more powerful. The Guild's usual strategies are proving insufficient, and they realize that to save their world, they must recruit and train a new generation of codersâ€”players like you.

A Call to Arms: New Recruits
As a new recruit in the Gopher Guild, you are thrust into a world on the brink of digital apocalypse. The recruitment process is rigorous, selecting only those with the potential to learn and master Golang quickly. You start as a novice, guided by seasoned Gopher mentors who impart their knowledge and skills through a series of challenging quests.

The Quests: Learning and Mastery
Each quest is a journey into a different part of the digital world, where you learn key concepts of Golang. These quests are not merely academic exercises but real battles against the virus's manifestations. You will encounter corrupted code in the form of digital beasts, rogue programs, and malfunctioning systems. Through solving coding challenges, you restore these anomalies to their proper state, gaining valuable experience and tools for your arsenal.

The Digital World: A Grand and Scary Landscape
The digital world is vast and varied, with regions representing different aspects of the codebase:

Cyber City: A sprawling metropolis of data streams and skyscrapers made of code. Here, you face complex urban puzzles and rogue AI systems.
Glitch Forest: A once-peaceful woodland now twisted by the virus, where corrupted nodes take the form of digital creatures.
Code Caverns: Deep underground, ancient code lies dormant, protected by powerful encryption that the virus seeks to corrupt.
Data Deserts: Vast, empty expanses where the virus has wiped out all code, creating a blank slate of digital nothingness.
The Virus: A Formidable Foe
The virus is a terrifying adversary, with an almost sentient ability to adapt and counteract the Gophers' efforts. It manifests in many forms, from simple bugs to complex, multi-layered threats. Each encounter with the virus is a test of your coding prowess and your ability to think critically and creatively.

Hope and Heroism: The Recruits' Role
Despite the darkness, there is hope. The new recruits bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to the fight. Your journey through the digital world is marked by moments of triumph as you restore corrupted sectors and bring stability back to the realm. The Gopher Guild celebrates each victory, and with every quest completed, you inch closer to uncovering the source of the virus and the ultimate showdown.

The Final Battle: Restoring the Code
As you grow stronger and more skilled, the ultimate challenge awaits: a final confrontation with the heart of the virus. This epic battle will test everything you've learned, pushing you to the limits of your abilities. With the fate of the digital world hanging in the balance, you must harness the full power of Golang to purge the virus once and for all, restoring peace and harmony to the digital realm.

In this expanded storyline, "GopherQuest: Code of the Future" becomes an epic saga of courage, learning, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. As a new recruit, you embark on a thrilling journey filled with danger, discovery, and the hope of restoring a world teetering on the edge of chaos.
